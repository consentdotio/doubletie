title: Introduction to Doubletie
description: A TypeScript toolkit for building self-hostable backend SDKs. Double Tie provides a complete set of tools to help developers create type-safe, self-hostable backend services that can be distributed as npm packages.
---

## What is Doubletie?

Doubletie is an open-source toolkit that transforms how developers build and distribute backend services. Built for modern development teams, it provides a unified solution for:

- Type-safe database operations
- Self-hostable backend services
- Distributable npm packages
- Complete end-to-end type safety

Gone are the days of:
- Complex monolithic backend frameworks
- Lack of type safety between client and server
- Vendor lock-in for backend services
- Limited control over data privacy
- Complex deployment and hosting setups

## Core Principles

### 1. Type Safety First
Building with TypeScript isn't just about developer experience - it's about creating more reliable software:

- End-to-end type inference from database to client
- Zero runtime type errors
- Comprehensive TypeScript support
- Type-safe query building

### 2. Developer Experience 
Backend development should feel natural in your workflow:

- Functional programming patterns
- Modern TypeScript patterns
- Intuitive model layer
- Comprehensive documentation

### 3. Self-Hosting as Standard
Every service should be self-hostable:

- Package your backend as npm modules
- Multiple deployment targets
- Zero config deployment
- Complete data control

### 4. Modular Architecture
Build and distribute backend functionality piece by piece:

- Composable packages
- Flexible adapter system
- Extensible through mixins
- Plugin architecture

## Coming Soon

We're actively working on additional packages to complete the toolkit:

- 🏗️ `@doubletie/sdk-builder` - Create type-safe SDK packages
- 📡 `@doubletie/client` - Type-safe client library generator
- 🛠️ `@doubletie/cli` - Migration and deployment tools
- 📊 `@doubletie/model-mapper` - Schema to type-safe models
- ⚡ `@doubletie/functions` - Self-hostable function runtime

## Why Double Tie?

Traditional backend frameworks focus on building monolithic applications. Double Tie takes a different approach by helping developers create distributable, self-hostable backend SDKs. This enables:

- 🏢 Companies to maintain control of their data while using third-party services
- 👩‍💻 Developers to distribute backend functionality as npm packages
- 🔐 Better data privacy through self-hosting
- 📦 Easier integration of backend services into existing applications
