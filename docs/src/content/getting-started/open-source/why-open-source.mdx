title: Building Self-Hosted SDKs in the Open
description: We believe great developer tools should be built in the open, with transparency and community collaboration at their core. This philosophy guides how we're building modern self-hosted SDK infrastructure.

## Open Source Foundation

Doubletie is built with a strong open source foundation:

- **Core Platform**: MIT licensed, ensuring your SDK tools remain free and open
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type inference from database to client
- **Query Builder**: Built on Kysely for type-safe database interactions
- **Deploy Options**: Support for Docker, AWS, Vercel and more

## Why We Chose Open Source

Self-hosted SDK infrastructure should be:

1. **Transparent**
   - See exactly how queries are built
   - Audit the code handling database operations
   - Understand the complete data flow

2. **Community-Driven**
   - Benefit from collective expertise
   - Shape the future of SDK tools
   - Share best practices globally

3. **Trustworthy**
   - No black boxes in SDK management
   - Full visibility into data handling
   - Community-verified security

4. **Flexible**
   - Self-host for complete control
   - Customize to your exact needs
   - Integrate with your existing stack


## Our Commitment

By choosing open source, we commit to:

- **Transparency**: All core code is public and auditable
- **Community**: Decisions made with community input
- **Quality**: Enterprise-grade while remaining open
- **Longevity**: Sustainable open source development
