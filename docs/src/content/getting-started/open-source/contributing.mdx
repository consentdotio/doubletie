## 🏠 House Rules

### Before You Start

- Check existing [issues](https://github.com/consentdotio/doubletie/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/consentdotio/doubletie/pulls) first
- **Always create an issue before starting development**
- Follow our PR template carefully

### Issue Approval Process

We use the `needs-approval` label to manage contributions:

#### For Contributors

- 🚫 **Needs Approval First:**
  - New features
  - Large-scale refactoring
  - Architecture changes
  - *Wait for a c15t.com team member to remove the `needs-approval` label*

- ✅ **Can Start Immediately:**
  - Bug fixes
  - Documentation updates
  - Performance improvements
  - Security fixes
  - Tests

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### 🤖 Automated Workflows

We leverage several automated workflows to ensure code quality:

1. **Code Quality**
   - Formatting: Biome automatically formats code
   - Types: TypeScript checks run on every PR
   - Tests: Vitest runs the test suite
   - Build: Turbo ensures everything builds correctly

2. **Dependencies**
   - Renovate keeps dependencies up to date
   - PNPM manages our packages
   - Changesets handles our versioning

3. **Pull Requests**
   - PR titles are checked for semantic versioning
   - Automated code review for common issues
   - Required checks must pass before merging

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/c15t.git
   cd c15t
   git switch -c my-feature
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   corepack enable  # Sets up PNPM
   pnpm install     # Installs dependencies
   ```

3. Make your changes and ensure the following pass:

   ```sh
   pnpm fmt         # Format code
   pnpm test        # Run tests
   pnpm build       # Build packages
   ```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create an Issue First**
   - For features/refactoring: Wait for approval (needs-approval label)
   - For bugs/docs: Can start work immediately

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow our coding standards (enforced by Biome)
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use our PR template
   - Link the related issue
   - Add screenshots for UI changes
   - Describe your changes clearly

4. **Automated Checks**
   The following will run automatically:
   - Code formatting (Biome)
   - Type checking (TypeScript)
   - Tests (Vitest)
   - Build verification (Turbo)
   - Dependency checks (Renovate)
   - PR title format
   - Issue linking

5. **Review Process**
   - Maintainers will review your code
   - Address any requested changes
   - Once approved, it will be merged

## Release Process

Releases are automated through our CI/CD pipeline:

1. Merge to `main` triggers version check
2. Changesets determines version bump
3. New version is published to npm
4. GitHub release is created
5. Documentation is updated
