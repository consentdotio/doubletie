## Key Concepts

This page explains the core concepts and design principles behind DoubleTie Logger.

### Understanding Log Levels

Log levels in DoubleTie Logger indicate the severity and importance of log messages. They are ordered from highest to lowest severity:

1. **error** - Critical issues requiring immediate attention
2. **warn** - Potential problems that don't prevent operation
3. **info** - General information about system operation
4. **success** - Successful operations (treated as info level when using custom handlers)
5. **debug** - Detailed information useful for debugging

When you configure a logger with a specific level, it will only show messages of that level or higher severity. For example:

```typescript
// This logger will show error, warn, and info messages but not debug
const logger = createLogger({ level: 'info' });

logger.error('This will be shown'); // Shows
logger.warn('This will be shown');  // Shows
logger.info('This will be shown');  // Shows
logger.debug('This won't be shown'); // Hidden
```

This filtering happens automatically based on your configuration, saving you from manually checking log levels throughout your code. It allows you to control verbosity with a single setting.

### The Benefits of Unified Logging

Unified logging is a pattern where all logging in your application flows through a single system. DoubleTie Logger enables this through its redirection features, offering several advantages:

1. **Consistency**: All logs follow the same format, making them easier to read and process
2. **Centralized Control**: Configure log levels and handling in one place
3. **Better Tooling**: Apply the same analysis and storage to all logs
4. **Simplified Debugging**: See the full picture of your application's behavior

Without unified logging, you might have:
- Console logs with one format
- Framework logs with another format
- Custom logs with yet another format

This fragmentation makes it difficult to get a complete view of your application's behavior. With DoubleTie Logger's redirection features, you can bring all logs under one roof.

### Structured Logging vs. String Concatenation

DoubleTie Logger encourages structured logging, where you pass discrete data alongside your message rather than concatenating everything into a string.

#### String Concatenation (Poor Practice)
```typescript
// Don't do this
logger.info(`User ${userId} logged in from ${ipAddress} at ${timestamp}`);
```

#### Structured Logging (Good Practice)
```typescript
// Do this instead
logger.info('User logged in', { 
  userId, 
  ipAddress, 
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString() 
});
```

The structured approach offers several advantages:

1. **Searchability**: Easily search for specific values
2. **Parsing**: Automatically extract data for analysis
3. **Filtering**: Apply filters based on specific fields
4. **Schema Evolution**: Add new fields without breaking existing processing

This approach also makes it easier to integrate with log aggregation systems and monitoring tools.

### Logger Extension Pattern

DoubleTie Logger uses an extension pattern that allows you to create specialized loggers with domain-specific methods while preserving the core logging functionality:

```typescript
import { createLogger, extendLogger } from '@doubletie/logger';

// Create an HTTP request logger
const httpLogger = extendLogger(
  createLogger({ level: 'info' }),
  {
    request: (method, url, body) => {
      return httpLogger.debug(`→ ${method} ${url}`, { body });
    },
    response: (status, body, timeMs) => {
      const level = status >= 400 ? 'error' : 'debug';
      return httpLogger[level](`← ${status}`, { body, timeMs });
    }
  }
);

// Use the specialized logger
httpLogger.request('POST', '/api/users', { name: 'Alice' });
httpLogger.response(201, { id: 123, name: 'Alice' }, 45);
```

This pattern allows you to:

1. Create domain-specific logging APIs
2. Apply consistent formatting and level rules
3. Keep your application code clean and readable
4. Group related logging functions together

### Result Pattern for Error Handling

DoubleTie Logger integrates with the Result pattern (from libraries like `neverthrow`) to provide clean error handling that:

1. Makes error paths explicit
2. Ensures errors are logged consistently
3. Avoids try/catch blocks and exception handling
4. Maintains the functional flow of your code

```typescript
import { err, ok } from 'neverthrow';
import { logResult } from '@doubletie/logger';

function validateEmail(email: string) {
  if (!email.includes('@')) {
    return err({
      message: 'Invalid email format',
      code: 'INVALID_EMAIL'
    });
  }
  return ok(email);
}

// If this returns an error, it will be logged automatically
const result = logResult(validateEmail('user-email'));

// Continue with the result handling
result.match(
  (validEmail) => {
    // Success path
  },
  () => {
    // Error path (error already logged)
  }
);
```

This pattern is especially powerful for:
- API request handling
- Validation operations
- Database operations
- Any code where errors are expected and should be explicitly handled

### Formatters and Output Control

DoubleTie Logger separates the concerns of:

1. **What** to log (message and data)
2. **How** to log it (formatting)
3. **Where** to send it (output)

This separation allows you to adapt the logger to different environments without changing your application code:

```typescript
// Development: Terminal-friendly colored output
registerFormatter('dev', colorfulDevFormatter);

// Production: JSON formatting for log aggregation
registerFormatter('prod', jsonLineFormatter);

// Test: Minimal output
registerFormatter('test', minimalFormatter);

// Configure based on environment
const logger = createLogger({
  formatter: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'prod' : 
             process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test' ? 'test' : 'dev'
});
```

The same application code will produce different outputs depending on the environment, without any changes to how you call the logger methods.

### OpenTelemetry Integration

DoubleTie Logger integrates with OpenTelemetry to provide:

1. **Distributed Tracing**: Track operations across services
2. **Automatic Spans**: Create spans for each log operation
3. **Contextual Enrichment**: Add trace IDs to logs

This integration allows you to:
- Correlate logs with traces
- Measure performance of operations
- Debug complex distributed systems

```typescript
import { createLogger } from '@doubletie/logger';
import { trace } from '@opentelemetry/api';

// Create a logger with telemetry
const logger = createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  telemetry: {
    tracer: trace.getTracer('my-service'),
    defaultAttributes: {
      'service.name': 'payment-processor',
      'deployment.environment': process.env.NODE_ENV
    }
  }
});
```
