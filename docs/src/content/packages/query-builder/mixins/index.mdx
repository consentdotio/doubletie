title: Model Mixins
description: Powerful model enhancement system that extends functionality with reusable, composable patterns
---
Model mixins extend your database models with powerful behaviors and utilities. Built on a functional composition pattern, mixins allow you to easily combine multiple enhancements together to create more specialized models.

## Available Mixins

Double Tie Query Builder provides the following built-in mixins:

| Mixin | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [`withAssignProperties`](/packages/query-builder/mixins/assign) | Creates model instances with data assignment capabilities |
| [`withCreatedAt`](/packages/query-builder/mixins/created-at) | Automatically adds timestamps when records are created |
| [`withUpdatedAt`](/packages/query-builder/mixins/updated-at) | Automatically updates timestamps when records are modified |
| [`withGlobalId`](/packages/query-builder/mixins/global-id) | Adds global ID functionality for GraphQL-friendly identifiers |
| [`withIdGenerator`](/packages/query-builder/mixins/id-generator) | Generates unique IDs with custom prefixes |
| [`withSlug`](/packages/query-builder/mixins/slug) | Creates and manages URL-friendly slugs |
| [`withCursorable`](/packages/query-builder/mixins/cursorable) | Adds cursor-based pagination for efficient list traversal |

## Composing Mixins

Mixins can be combined using functional composition to create models with multiple enhanced behaviors:

```typescript
import { createDatabase, createModel } from '@doubletie/query-builder';
import {
  withUpdatedAt,
  withSlug,
  withIdGenerator
} from '@doubletie/query-builder/mixins';

// Create a base model
const db = createDatabase<Database>(/* config */);
const baseModel = createModel(db, 'posts', 'id');

// Apply multiple mixins with composition
const PostModel = withUpdatedAt(
  withSlug(
    withIdGenerator(baseModel, { prefix: 'post' }),
    'slug',
    'title'
  ),
  'updatedAt'
);

// Now PostModel has all three behaviors
const post = await PostModel.insertWithGeneratedId({
  title: 'Hello World',
  content: 'This is my first post'
}); // Has ID, slug, and timestamps
```

## Creating Custom Mixins

You can create your own custom mixins by following the functional enhancement pattern:

```typescript
function withCustomBehavior<
  TDatabase,
  TTableName extends keyof TDatabase & string,
  TIdColumnName extends keyof TDatabase[TTableName] & string
>(model: ModelFunctions<TDatabase, TTableName, TIdColumnName>) {
  return {
    ...model,
    
    // Add new methods
    customMethod() {
      // Implementation
    },
    
    // Override existing methods
    findById: async (id, ...args) => {
      console.log(`Finding record with ID: ${id}`);
      return model.findById(id, ...args);
    }
  };
}
```
